The DRC will function closely with Academic \nGraduate Studies & Research (Ph. D. Programme) Division (AGSRD) for smooth running \nof Ph. D. Programme of the Institute. DRC may use the enclosed formats in their routine \nfunctions. \n \n \n2. Details about DRC composition and functions \n2.1 Departmental Research Committee (DRC) \n \nEach Department has a \u201cDepartmental Research Committee\u201d (DRC), consisting of \nHead of Department (HOD) as ex-officio member and Chairperson, and 2 to 6 faculty \nmembers, at the level of Assistant Professor or above, who are active in research. The size \nof DRC may depend on the number of faculty members in the Department. One of the \nmembers acts as its Convener. The term of DRC members is of two years. DRC is \napproved by the Director of the Campus on the recommendation of HOD through Dean \nAGSRD and helps AGSRD in operations from admission to final thesis submission of a \nPh. D. Candidate. \n \n \n2.2 Admission of on-campus candidates \n \nDRC plays an important role in admission of the Ph. D. candidate. Admissions \nDivision sends a link for list and details of candidates applied to all HOD\u2019s. HOD, in \nconsultation with DRC members, adopts a suitable criteria and accordingly shortlists the \ncandidates to be called for test/interview. Based on HOD recommendation, final list is \ncompiled by Associate Dean, AGSRD. The applications of shortlisted candidates will be \nhanded over to the DRC for further review. The examination paper (wherever needed) \nwill be made by the DRC in consultation with other campuses, thus, the same \nexamination paper will be used by all campuses for a particular discipline. On the day of \nexamination, DRC will conduct the test, evaluates the test paper and conduct interview of \nshort listed candidates.. For the purpose of interview, DRC may co-opt some more faculty \nmembers depending on need and circumstances. \n \nSelection & recommendation of vertical transfer students should be done by the \nHOD/DRC, only after their source of fellowship/funding is identified and approved. \n \nDuring interaction with the candidates, DRC will also identify the area of \nresearch, notional supervisor, DAC members and the course package for the shortlisted \ncandidates. This information will be send to Associate Dean, AGSRD in the appropriate \nformat (enclosed in this document). Students holding first degree (B.Tech, B.E., M A, \nM.Sc etc.) must be prescribed a minimum of six courses spread in two semesters with \nminimum of 24 units. \n \n1"

The procedure for application is given in the guidelines document (for on campus or off \ncampus students, available at Important Proformas and Guidelines section of http://www.bits-\npilani.ac.in/university/AcademicResearch/Overview). \n \nFor research proposal submission, initially two hard copies (of summary and proposal \ndocument) have to be submitted. However, for final submission, one hard copy (of summary \nand proposal document) and one softcopy in a CD (summary and proposal document as \nseparate doc files) along with relevant appendices have to be submitted to AGSRD. Simply \nsubmitting the research proposal does not make it fit for acceptance in the research board. \nNormally the process given below is followed before the research proposal is finalized to be put \nin the research board: \n \n1. For on-campus candidates: \n \nOnce a Ph.D. student clears the required qualifying examination, he/she, in consultation \nwith his/her notional supervisor and the DAC members will decide upon the topic, the co-\nsupervisor (if required), prepare a research proposal and submit it to DRC. DRC will send it to \nDAC members for review. The candidate has to make corrections as per the suggestions of \nDAC members and will make an oral presentation before the DAC, DRC members and \nothers in the department concerned. Based upon DAC recommendation, the DRC will \nrecommend to Dean AGSRD, through Associate Dean- AGSRD for approval of (i) supervisor (and \n \n \n2"

Proposed Topic of Research \n \nInvestigation of the structure-activity relationships of novel purine and pyrimidine \nnucleotide derivatives targeting orotidine -5\u00b4-monophosphate decarboxylase (ODCase). \n \n4. Objective of the Proposed Research \n \nTo design libraries of pyrimidine and purine nucleotides with structural variations in \nnucleic base and sugar moieties and to build structure-activity relationships for the \ninhibition of the catalytic activity of orotidine -5\u00b4-monophosphate decarboxylase \n(ODCase). \n \n5. Background \n \nODCase is one of the most proficient enzymes known which is involved in the catalysis \nof decarboxylation of orotidine-5\u00b4-monophosphate (OMP) to uridine-5\u00b4-monophosphate \n(UMP) in the last step in the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. Malaria \nparasite lacks pyrimidine salvage pathway. Due to ODCase\u2019s important role in the de \nnovo synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides, its inhibition will have a potential role in the \ntreatment of malaria. Derivatives of the pyrimidine and purine nucleotides could be \npotential inhibitors of ODCase. \n \n6. Methodology \n \nA thorough literature survey is carried out on various aspects of the proposed research \ntopic, in various peer-reviewed journals, patents, books and other research resources. \nDerivatives of UMP, CMP-N3-oxide and XMP would be synthesized as per schemes \ndisclosed in the proposal. The synthesized nucleotides will be completely characterized \nby using several spectroscopic techniques such as NMR, mass, UV, IR, and X-ray \ncrystallography to confirm their structures. These synthesized compounds will be tested \nfor their efficacy to inhibit ODCase. This would be followed by documentation, \npublications and thesis writing. \n \n7. Expected Outcome \n \nThe proposed research will lead to the development of potent ODCase inhibitors and \nfrom resulting SAR studies further lead optimization will be carried out. We anticipate \nthat the overall outcome of this research will be a potent antimalarial drug active against \ncurrent resistant Plasmodial strains. \n \n \n17"

Sexually transmitted C. trachomatis infection is an important public health \nconcern because of its adverse effects on reproduction [1]. In India alone a high chlamydial \nprevalence rate (28%) was found in symptomatic patients [2]. In women, infection with C. \ntrachomatis causes pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and has long term consequences \u2013 such as \ninfertility, ectopic pregnancy and chronic pelvic pain- that are secondary to scarring of the \nfallopian tubes (caused by salpingitis) and ovaries. In addition, infection with C. trachomatis \nfelicitates the transmission of HIV [3] and might be a co factor in human papilloma virus (HPV)-\ninduced cervical neoplasia [4-5]. The pathological mechanism by which C. trachomatis induces \nscarring is not well understood.

Every candidate has to \nfollow the procedures laid down for fulfilling the requirements of PhD programme of \nthe Institute. \n \nThese pages explain two important aspects of the programme viz. Semester-wise \nOperations and PhD Thesis submission. The Institute follows semester-wise pattern and \na candidate is required to register in prescribed PhD courses in every semester by \npaying requisite amount of fees till all the requirements of the programme are \ncompleted and the thesis is submitted. Fee payment is handled by SWD & it is the \nresponsibility of every student to interface with SWD and pay the fees before due date. \nNonpayment of fees will result in withholding of registrations formalities & room \nallotment.  \nThe candidate is supposed to plan his/her work and is evaluated continuously by \nthe respective supervisor/mentor. The overall operation of PhD programme is governed \nby the Academic Regulations of the Institute. \n \nThe paragraphs to follow give details about operational features of the \nprogramme, semester-wise registration pattern, requirements of various courses, pre-\nsubmission seminar and PhD Thesis submission. Various proforma and checklists have \nalso been appended and the same may be photocopied and used. A calendar of various \nevents for a typical semester is also included. All the candidates and supervisors should \nrefer to this document throughout the duration of the PhD programme and adhere to \nthe deadlines of various activities.

Operation of PhD Programme at BITS \n \nEvery candidate has to complete certain activities during his/her PhD \nprogramme as given in the following paragraphs. The process starts with applying for \nPhD programme of the Institute and getting admitted. \n \n2.1 Departmental Research Committee (DRC) \n \nEvery candidate must interact closely with DRC of the department he/she is \nconcerned. Each Department has a \u201cDepartmental Research Committee\u201d (DRC), \nconsisting of Head of Department (HOD) as ex-officio member and Chairperson, and 2 to \n6 faculty members, at the level of Assistant Professor or above, who are active in \nresearch.

DRC is approved by the Director of the Campus on the recommendation of \nHOD through Associate Dean and Dean, AGSRD and helps AGSRD in operations from \nadmission to final thesis submission. \n \nFor each PhD student, the DRC will recommend a notional thesis supervisor or \nmentor based on department need and student\u2019s area of interest. Normally only PhD \nholders with regular employment are eligible to act as PhD Supervisor/Co-supervisor. \nFurther, for each PhD student, the DRC will, in consultation with the notional supervisor \nof the student, appoint two additional members for Doctoral Advisory Committee \n(DAC). For students in interdisciplinary area there can be DAC member(s) from other \ndepartment/campuses based on topic of research. \nIn case any PhD candidate (e.g. faculty) choose the supervisor from another \ndepartment then the candidate will come under the purview of DRC to which the \nSupervisor belongs. \n  \n2.2 Admission \nA candidate is normally admitted to the PhD programme after passing his/her \nPhD qualifying examination. A few candidates may be admitted to the programme as \nprovisional candidates before passing the PhD qualifying examination. This provision is \napplicable to full time research scholars on the campus. \n*Modalities of PhD Admissions for Lectures/Faculty joining Hyderabad campus under \nthe faculty Development program: \ni. \nFaculty members/Lectures after completing their joining formalities can appear \nfor PhD qualifying in their department by following the regular course adopted \nfor PhD qualifying. E.g.:- Filling up of form, identification of subjects, \nIdentification of notional supervisor, DAC members etc. \nii. \nOnce the Registrar signed result letter is received from Pilani and if the \ncandidate has cleared, then he/she goes to Admissions Office, Hyderabad \ncampus with the pass letter and fill up PhD Admission form. \niii. \nAdmission office will grant admission to the faculty based on his qualifying \nresult and immediately generate ID No. \niv. \nAdmissions to PhD can be done for faculty anytime during the semester. There \nis no need to wait for PhD advertisement or filling up online form etc. \nv. \nDecision on faculty admission to PhD is handled exclusively by the campus \nAdmission office. \nvi. \nUsing the ID no., the faculty can go ahead and submit for Research proposal for \nDCC/Research Board approval. \nvii. All other information pertaining to PhD available in PhD Guidelines brochure \ncirculated to all enrolled PhD candidates. \n* Regular full time and part time PhD admissions process kindly refer to the \nadmissions website of BITS Pilani.
