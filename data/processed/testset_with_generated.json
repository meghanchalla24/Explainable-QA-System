        "generated_answer": "Travel approvals must be obtained before undertaking any travel using project funds. Specifically, the Principal Investigator (PI) must submit a form to the GCIR office to obtain approval. This approval process ensures that travel expenses are managed effectively, align with the project's budget, and adhere to the funding agency's guidelines. \n\nIn detail, the PI should submit the form initially to the GCIR office before travel. After completing the travel, the PI must settle the balance by visiting the ERP Academic System - SRCD activity, choosing the appropriate project and budget head for reimbursement or settling the advance. The related travel bills and expenses must be documented and submitted along with a copy of the auto-generated approval email, supported by a detailed annexure of the bills. \n\nTherefore, to answer the query directly: Travel approvals must be obtained before undertaking any travel, and this is done by submitting the required form to the GCIR office."

        "question": "What is the duration of the PhD programme?",
        "answer": "A student must submit the thesis within ten semesters (excluding summer terms), counted from the semester following the qualifying examination. If the student fails to do so, they may request the DRC for an extension, which is limited to a maximum of four semesters.
